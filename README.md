# 💓 Detection of Coronary Arterial Disease Using E-Nose Technology

This project presents an innovative **IoT + Machine Learning** approach for detecting **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)** by analyzing **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)** from a patient’s breath using **Electronic Nose (E-Nose)** sensors.

---

## 🩺 Overview
Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.  
This project proposes a **non-invasive diagnostic system** using semiconductor gas sensors (MQ-4 and MQ-7) and a microcontroller (ESP32) to analyze VOCs like **acetone, benzene, and toluene** exhaled in breath samples.

The VOC data is transmitted via Wi-Fi to the **ThingSpeak IoT cloud**, processed with **Python and Machine Learning**, and visualized in **Power BI** for CAD detection and trend prediction.

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - MQ-4 and MQ-7 sensors capture gas concentrations from breath samples.
   - ESP32 converts analog sensor values into digital signals.

2. **Data Transmission**
   - ESP32 sends sensor data to **ThingSpeak Cloud** via Wi-Fi for storage and visualization.

3. **Machine Learning Analysis**
   - A Python-based ML model classifies breath data into **CAD** or **Healthy** categories.
   - Time series forecasting predicts upcoming trends in VOC levels.

4. **Visualization**
   - **ThingSpeak** for real-time gas trends.
   - **Power BI** for VOC analysis and CAD detection dashboards.
